## Description
I completed this project over the course of 72 hours using godot, free assets, [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/), and lots of hard work.
Lunar Languish is an asteroids-like game with an infinite loop created for Mini Jam 130: Lunar. You can press shift to activate a 2 second invincibility shield that has a cooldown of 10 seconds. The game gets progressively harder as more asteroids get spawned in per wave.
